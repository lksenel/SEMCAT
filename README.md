# Semantic Structure and Interpretability of Word Embeddings

This rapository implements the code for our paper named: [Semantic Structure and Interpretability of Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00331), where we propose a statistical method to uncover the latent semantic structure in the dense word embeddings. To perform our analysis we introduce a new dataset (SEMCAT) that contains more than 6500 words semantically grouped under 110 categories. We further propose a method to quantify the interpretability of the word embeddings; the proposed method is a practical alternative to the classical word intrusion test that requires human intervention.

### Requirements

Our implementation is in MATLAB.
